`rules_contest` is a collection of [Bazel] rules for maintaining programming
contest problems. `rules_contest` helps you automate tasks to prepare
programming contest problems, such as:

- Building and testing datasets
- Building and testing reference solutions
- Building problem statements
- Building a progress tracker

Rules provided by `rules_contest` are designed to be simple and composable.
Even if some existing rules do not fit your purpose, you can easily replace
them with your own custom rules while still using other useful rules.
