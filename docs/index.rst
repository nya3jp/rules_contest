rules_contest is a collection of Bazel rules for maintaining programming
contest problems. rules_contest helps you automate tasks to prepare programming
contest problems, such as:

- Building and testing datasets
- Building and testing reference solutions
- Building problem statements
- Building a progress tracker

Rules provided by rules_contest are designed to be simple and composable. Even
if some existing rules do not fit your purpose, you can easily replace them
with your own custom rules while still using other useful rules.
